    "# Record of Thinking\n",
    "<p style=\"font-family:verdana; font-size:16px;\">If I was to use one phrase to describe this project I would use \"practical\" because unlike a REPL assignment which has one goal, a project has many goals. A REPL may ask you to build a single function or return one value, where is in a whole game you will build many functions whose success depends on the others. In a project you're not given a model data structure you have to create your own. When you're creating a project you're creating something that has never been created, you cannot just google it. The biggest surprise was when it worked, at that point I had  over 29 different versions of my program in my downloads folder. At that point I was expecting to see \"ERROR LINE ##\" scrolling across the screen every time, so when I actually saw the game work I was actually taken by surprise.After deciding to restart the project I consulted Sean and Luka at break for ideas on how to manipulate the newly modeled data structure. Sean had affirmed some of my previously existing ideas, and Luka was useless as usual.If I had more time for this project I would have created a more user friendly  control scheme using a four directional joy stick instead of three buttons. However the joy stick has much more incoming data to read and evalute compared to the single button.I became stuck when i discovered the Microbit display.show() function used a string instead of an array to represent the 25 leds.To fix the issue I essentially created my own display.show() function that uses my own data structure.</p>"
